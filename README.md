# EasyFedoraMedia

EasyFedoraMedia is a script that automates the installation of multimedia packages and codecs on a fresh install of Fedora.

**What does it do?**

This script adds the RPM Fusion repositories (free and non-free) to your system and installs a range of multimedia packages, including gstreamer plugins, codecs, and the MPV media player.

**Warning**

I'm yet to test this so use at your own risk

**How to use**

To use this script, clone or download it from the GitHub repository. Save the file as multimedia_setup.sh and make it executable by running `chmod +x multimedia_setup.sh`. Then, run the script by executing `./multimedia_setup.sh` in the terminal.
